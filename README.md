### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**kwmski7/kwmski7** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chatbot for green/climate technology.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Japanese, Indonesian, Spanish, and langchain.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on atmospheric sciences, climate prediction and its application, etc...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with translating my research-level codes to industry-level products.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... no... don't ask me anything for now. I still learning to figure out how things are going.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: In one of your potential infinite trials, I am sure we meet at one point at least in a 4-D space.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Whatever you want.
- âš¡ Fun fact: What is a "fact", anyway.
